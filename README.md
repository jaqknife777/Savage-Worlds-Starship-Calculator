# Savage Worlds Starship Builder (The Last Parsec)

A single-page HTML/CSS/JS app to build starships for **Savage Worlds** (Last Parsec style).  
It calculates base stats by Size, applies **Modifications**, and manages **Vehicular Weapons** (including missiles/torpedoes/bombs with launchers/bays + ammo bundles). A printable **Starship Stat Block** is generated as you edit.
